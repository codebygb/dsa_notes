## Level 1 Beginner

- **Level 1 (Beginner):** 5 Foundational Topics

  1. [**Introduction to Algorithms & Complexity:**](level1/intro_to_algorithms_and_complexity.md)

     - What is an algorithm?
     - Why analyze algorithms?
     - Asymptotic Notation (Big O, Big Omega, Big Theta) - understanding how we measure efficiency.
     - Time Complexity & Space Complexity.

  2. [**Arrays:**](level1/arrays.md)

     - What are arrays? (Static vs. Dynamic)
     - Basic operations: Access, Insertion, Deletion, Search.
     - Time and space complexity of array operations.
     - Common use cases and limitations.

  3. [**Linked Lists:**](level1/linked_lists.md)

     - What are linked lists? (Singly, Doubly, Circular)
     - Nodes and pointers/references.
     - Basic operations: Insertion (at head, tail, middle), Deletion, Search, Traversal.
     - Time and space complexity compared to arrays.
     - Advantages and disadvantages.

  4. [**Stacks:**](level1/stacks.md)

     - What is a stack? (LIFO - Last-In, First-Out principle)
     - Core operations: Push, Pop, Peek (or Top).
     - Implementation using arrays and linked lists.
     - Time and space complexity.
     - Common applications (function calls, expression evaluation, backtracking).

  5. [**Queues:**](level1/queues.md)
     - What is a queue? (FIFO - First-In, First-Out principle)
     - Core operations: Enqueue, Dequeue, Peek (or Front).
     - Implementation using arrays (including circular arrays) and linked lists.
     - Time and space complexity.
     - Common applications (request processing, breadth-first search, scheduling).
